Update 8.2 support




## Known Bugs

- Resource nodes have the default worldgrid material when they are in the middle of being built or deconstructed. This corrects itself after the build/deconstruct animation is complete.

## Notes

**If you're updating from the old BuildableResourceNodes mod, SML will warn you that you're missing the old mod when you first load your save. That's fine - this mod automatically redirects the old buildings to the new ones in order to preserve your existing nodes.**
