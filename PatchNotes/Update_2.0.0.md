Update 6 support. This update brought to you by Robb#6731




## Bugfixes

- Fixed that built nodes had absurdly large interaction hitboxes; this was caused by Coffee Stain adding a specific collision channel for interaction.

## Notes

Turtlefight (original mod author) has not been responding to contact attempts, so I (Robb) decided to upload this in the mean time.

**If you're updating from the old BuildableResourceNodes mod, SML will warn you that you're missing the old mod when you first load your save. That's fine - this mod automatically redirects the old buildings to the new ones in order to preserve your existing nodes.**
