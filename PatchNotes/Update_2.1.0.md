Moved unlocks to tiers that are in-line with when you can first access the resource. Thanks for the feedback TheGreatDragonKing!




## Changes

**Remember, if you don't like where the mod has placed some of these schematics (or their costs), you can use [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib) to change it to what you want!**

- Moved the "Buildable Geysers" Milestone to Tier 5
  - Geothermal Generators require Heavy Modular Frames (T4) and Circuit Boards (all recipes for it require T5)
- Moved the "Buildable Caterium Resource Nodes" Milestone to Tier 2
  - Caterium Ore is unlocked for scanning in the hub at T6, but its mam tree can be accessed at any point
- Moved the "Buildable Raw Quartz Resource Nodes" Milestone to Tier 2
  - Raw Quartz is unlocked for scanning in the hub at T7, but its mam tree can be accessed at any point
- Moved the "Buildable Sulfur Resource Nodes" Milestone to Tier 3
  - Sulfur Ore is unlocked for scanning in the hub at T7, but its mam tree can be accessed at any point, but coal (T3) is required to make any appreciable use of it
- Moved the "Buildable S.A.M. Resource Nodes" Milestone to Tier 1
  - The base game does not use this item, and it is accessible as soon as you find a node for it.

## Notes

**If you're updating from the old BuildableResourceNodes mod, SML will warn you that you're missing the old mod when you first load your save. That's fine - this mod automatically redirects the old buildings to the new ones in order to preserve your existing nodes.**
