# Buildable Resource Nodes

_U6+ Version of [Buildable Resource Nodes](https://ficsit.app/mod/BuildableResourceNodes) by Turtlefight, ported by Robb_

**NOTE - If you're updating from the old BuildableResourceNodes mod, SML will warn you that you're missing the old mod when you first load your save. That's fine - this mod automatically redirects the old buildings to the new ones in order to preserve your existing nodes.**

Are you tired of searching for resource nodes on the map?
Then this mod is for you!

You can build all the Resource Nodes & Resource Wells you can find in the game once you have researched the corresponding Milestones.

## Resource Wells

These are a bit difficult to place due to their large size.
You only place the core, however keep in mind that you also need a lot of space for the satellite nodes.
You need an approx. 15x15 foundations large free space to place a Resource Well without clipping.
